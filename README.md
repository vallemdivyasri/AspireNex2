# Titanic Survival Prediction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using the AdaBoost Classifier. The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset used in machine learning and statistical modeling to showcase the predictive power of algorithms.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict whether a given passenger survived the Titanic disaster using the AdaBoost Classifier. AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a powerful ensemble method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle. [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishkumarjayswal/titanic-datasets)
It contains information about the passengers, including their age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived the disaster.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline. The following steps were taken to preprocess the data:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

 ## Modeling
The model used for predicting survival is the AdaBoost Classifier. AdaBoost is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. The following steps were taken to build the model:

- Importing the AdaBoost Classifier
- Initializing the classifier
- Training the model on the training data
- Making predictions on the test data
- Evaluation
  
Model evaluation is performed to determine the effectiveness of the model. The following metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Conclusion
The AdaBoost Classifier provides a robust model for predicting the survival of Titanic passengers. The model's performance can be further improved by fine-tuning hyperparameters and incorporating more features.

## Future Work
Future work may include:

- Experimenting with other classification algorithms
- Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the AdaBoost Classifier
- Incorporating additional features such as the cabin information and ticket fare
